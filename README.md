# Hello, I'm Milovan Antić or  @Milovan1995 👋

## Development Philosophy

I firmly believe that consistent effort and perseverance are key to personal development, especially in the fast-paced world of programming. I approach projects with a well-thought-out plan, but I'm also adaptable and ready to find solutions on the fly.

## Interests

When I'm not coding, I cherish quality time spent with family and friends. I also enjoy solitude, whether it's going for long walks or diving into a good book.
