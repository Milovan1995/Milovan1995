# Hello, I'm Milovan Antiƒá üëã

I'm a passionate learner and a web developer from Podgorica, Montenegro. With a background in mechanical engineering, I decided to switch gears and dive into the world of programming in january 2023.

- üìú Proud recipient of a Udemy certificate for Full Stack Web Development from App Brewery - London, UK.
- üîç I have a deep appreciation for the logical problem-solving aspect of programming, and I enjoy the challenges it presents.

## Projects

I'm currently working on both the backend and frontend for an exciting project called "Capital Cities Quiz Game." This interactive quiz game is designed to test your knowledge of capital cities from around the world. While the project is still a work in progress, I'm dedicated to bringing this educational and fun experience to life. Stay tuned for updates on its development journey!

## Development Philosophy

I firmly believe that consistent effort and perseverance are key to personal development, especially in the fast-paced world of programming. I approach projects with a well-thought-out plan, but I'm also adaptable and ready to find solutions on the fly.

## Interests

When I'm not coding, I cherish quality time spent with family and friends. I also enjoy solitude, whether it's going for long walks or diving into a good book.

Let's connect, collaborate, and learn together. Feel free to explore my repositories, and let's build amazing things together!
